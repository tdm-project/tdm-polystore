  /sources:
    get:
      summary: "Get a list of sources."
      description: >
        Query a list of data sources.

        With no parameters, return all sources. When ``roi``,
        ``after`` and ``before`` are specified, return all sources
        that have reported an event that intesect the corresponding
        spatio-temporal region. It is
        also possible to filter by any of the following:

          * entity_type;
          * entity_category;
          * stationary True/False.

        Moreover, sources can also be filtered by generic attributes
        stored in their description field.

        The roi should be specified using one of the following:
         * circle((center_lon, center_lat), radius_in_meters)
         * FIXME: rectangle?
         * FIXME: arbitrary GeoJson?

         ## Example request

            GET /sources?roi=circle((9.22, 30.0), 1000)
                        &after=2019-05-02T11:00:00Z
                        &before=2019-05-02T11:50:25Z HTTP/1.1

            GET /sources?controlledProperties=temperature,humidity (unencoded URL)

        ## Parameters

        * roi: consider only sources with footprint intersecting
          the given roi e.g., ``circle((9.3, 32), 1000)``

        * after: consider only sources reporting  after (included)
          this time, e.g., ``2019-02-21T11:03:25Z``

        * before: consider only sources reporting strictly before
          this time, e.g., ``2019-02-22T11:03:25Z``

        * {other attribute}: select sources whose description has the
            specified value(s) for the chosen attribute
            (top-level JSON key, e.g., controlledProperties=temperature)

            You can provide extra parameters to this API endpoint, with a
            corresponding value, to filter sources against their description.
            For any of these extra parameters, the service will check the
            top-level of the source description object return only sources that
            contain the attribute and the matching value.
            Example: `controlledProperties=temperature`
